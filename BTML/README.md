# Behaviour Tree Markup Language (BTML)

Adheres to the [Off-side rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule), where the children of each node are at the same indentation level.

A node is generated by adding a symbol of the specified set to a line. Everthing after the symbol until the end of the line will be the name of the node.

## Leaf nodes

Must be at the end of each branch. They are ticked, return a result and the branch finishes.

### `!` - *Action*
Do an action and return the result.

### `?` - *Condition*
Return success if condition is met. Cannot return RUNNING.

### `#` - *Subtree*
It allows a leaf to lead into another tree. Whatever comes after the `#` needs to be the name of the file (e.g. `subtree.btml`) that defines the subtree.

## Composites

Have multiple children and run all children on tick.

### `&` - *Sequence*
Tries to run all children. Fails if any child fails.

### `|` - *Selector*
Tries to run all children. Fails if all children fail.

## Decorators

Have one child and modify its behaviour.

### `Â¬` - *Negator*
Run child and negate result.

### `<n>` - *Repeater*
Run child `n` times. `n` must be a number If `n` is `0`, repeats forever.

### `*` - *Repeat until fail*
Run child until it fails.

### `^` - *Succeeder*
Run child and suceed.

### `"` - *Timer*
Wait X and run child
