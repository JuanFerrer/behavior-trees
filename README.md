# Behavior Trees

**Final year project**. Given the popularity of behaviour trees, I thought a simple tool to create them would be helpful. Also, some sort of markup language for tree notation would help normalize the tree creation across different languages.

The project consists of the following parts:
- Fluent API for tree building (dynamic/static library)
- A simple markup language ([BTML](https://github.com/JuanFerrer/behavior-trees/blob/master/BTML/README.md)) and a parser
- A DirectX app for tree modification and visualisation
- A couple of demos (and probably a live demo) to showcase the project
